Here's a concise and well-structured answer formatted for your GitHub README file:

### 🖥️ CORS & Proxy in Backend Development  

#### 🔹 What is CORS?  
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security mechanism that restricts web applications from making requests to a different domain than the one that served them. It is used in backend development to prevent unauthorized access and protect APIs.  

#### 🔹 What is a Proxy?  
A proxy acts as an intermediary between a frontend application and a backend server, enabling seamless communication by bypassing CORS restrictions and improving performance.  

#### 📌 Example in Next.js (Custom API Route)  
In `next.config.js`:  
```js
module.exports = {
  async rewrites() {
    return [
      {
        source: "/api/:path*",
        destination: "https://external-api.com/:path*",
      },
    ];
  },
};
```

#### 📌 Example in Vite (Proxy Configuration)  
In `vite.config.js`:  
```js
export default defineConfig({
  server: {
    proxy: {
      "/api": {
        target: "https://external-api.com",
        changeOrigin: true,
        rewrite: (path) => path.replace(/^\/api/, ""),
      },
    },
  },
});
```  

🔹 **Use CORS for security & Proxy for seamless API calls in frontend development!** 🚀
